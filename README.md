I print these and sell them **at cost** so if you want them hmu [on twitter](https://twitter.com/k00bideh) or [on telegram](https://t.me/k00bideh)

I got these printed at 7.5" x 1.5" as a bumper sticker at [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/)

### hat.psd
I recommend getting the hats printed on [Otto 39-165 5-panel high crown trucker hats](https://ottocap.com/39-165-5-panel-high-crown-mesh-back-trucker-hat.html) (IMO the best truckers) in gold. I ordered mine from [Cap Bargain](https://capbargain.com/).
